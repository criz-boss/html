<b>In the beginning, Tim created the HyperText Markup Language. The Internet
was without form and void, and text was upon the face of the monitor and
the Hands of Tim were moving over the face of the keyboard. </b>
<p><i>And Tim said,
Let there be links; and there were links. And Tim saw that the links were
good; and Tim separated the links from the text. Tim called the links
Anchors, and the text He called Other Stuff. And the whole thing together
was the first Web Page.</i>
